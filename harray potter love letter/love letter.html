        Dear <span>Ronald</span>,<br>
        <br>
        I know we have been friends for a long time, and I'd hate to see our friendship dissolve after this.<br>
        But this has been on my mind a lot lately, and I'm afraid to say, that I must tell you how I really feel.<br>
        <br>
        I love you, to say the least.<br> 
        I like how you are so cute and clumsy on your broomstick, and I like how your many freckles <br>sometimes resemble chicken pox so much, that I actually wonder if you are contagious.<br> 
        Not that you are, of course. <br>
        After all, they're just freckles.<br>
       <br>
       Anyways, I haven't time to spare to tell you this in person.<br>
       I've just been so caught up with schooling and McGonagall is making me take extra classes. <br>
       I know you don't exactly care for school, <span>Ronald</span>, but you could at least take the time to show up for<br> classes.<br> 
       I'm telling you this because the last time you chose not to show up, Flitwick threatened to fail you.<br>
       <br>
       Anyways, I'm getting terribly off of the topic.<br>
       <br>
       If you wish to continue being friends, I am absolutely fine with that.<br>
       After all, I don't want to make things awkward, especially since Harry didn't do so well with Cho. <br>
       Speaking of Harry, have you noticed how he's been depressed lately? <br>
       I think it's because of Sirius.<br>
       After all, it is the anniversary of his death tomorrow.<br>
       I propose we take him out for a butterbeer sometime soon to cheer him up. <br>
       What do you think about that?<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       Like I was saying before, no hard feelings about this okay?<br> 
       But if you do happen to feel the same way about me, would you please let me know? <br>
       realize you broke up with Lavender lately, so I know you don't have a girlfriend. <br>
       That is probably the only reason I've worked up the courage to actually write this.<br>
       <br>
        So, <span>Ronald</span>, please reply. Whether it is a yes or no, I'm fine with either.<br>
        But please, don't tell Harry about this latest affair.<br> 
        I still want things to be normal between us.<br>
        <br>
        My love and condolences,<br>
        Hermione<br>
        <br>
        Want to see my dream where I kiss you?
